# Serum Wavetables Backup

This repository is a backup of waveforms for Serum, a popular VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugin developed by Xfer Records.

## What is a Wavetable?

A wavetable is a collection of single-cycle waveforms that can be used to create complex sounds. Each waveform in the table represents a different timbre, and by scanning through these waveforms, a synthesizer can produce dynamic and evolving sounds. Wavetables allow for a wide range of sonic possibilities.

## How Wavetables are Used in Serum

Serum is a wavetable synthesizer that allows users to import, edit, and manipulate wavetables to create unique sounds. In Serum, wavetables can be used in the following ways:

- **Oscillators**: Serum uses wavetables as the primary sound source for its oscillators. Users can select and scan through different waveforms to shape the sound.
- **Modulation**: Wavetables can be modulated using various sources such as LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators) and envelopes to create dynamic changes in the sound.
- **Effects**: Serum provides a range of effects that can be applied to wavetables, including distortion, reverb, and delay, to further enhance the sound.

This repository serves as a backup of various wavetables that can be used within Serum to expand your sound design capabilities.

## Usage

To use these wavetables in Serum:

1. Download the wavetables from this repository.
2. Open Serum in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
3. Import the wavetables into Serum by dragging and dropping them into the oscillator section or using the import function.
